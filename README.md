## Prerequisites

### Create a Notion Integration
In order for Notion2Markdown to have access to your Notion account, you must first set up a new Internal Integration, which can be done on the [My Integrations page](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations).

Note: You only need to ensure the **Read Content** box is checked under the Capabilities for your integration.

### Connect a Database to your Integration
Now you need to connect a Database to your new Integration.

Back in the Notion app, go to your Database, select the â‹¯ button in the top-right, then select "Connect to" and choose your new Integration. (If your Integration isn't displayed, try refreshing Notion.)

## Installation

### CLI via [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/mint)
To install `notion2markdown` and link it globally:
```bash
mint install khaptonstall/notion2markdown
```

Alternatively, you can add `notion2markdown` to your [Mintfile](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint#mintfile). Running `mint boostrap` in the same directory will then install all Swift packages in your Mintfile without linking them globally.

In your Mintfile:
```
khaptonstall/notion2markdown@0.1.0
```

### Swift Package Manager

Add the following to your `Package.swift` dependencies:
```swift
// In your dependencies array:
.package(url: "https://github.com/khaptonstall/Notion2Markdown", branch: "main")

// In the desired target or executable:
.executableTarget(
    name: "MyExecutableTarget",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "Notion2MarkdownCore", package: "Notion2Markdown"),
    ]
)
```

## CLI Usage
To use `notion2markdown`, you'll need both your Notion Integration token and the identifier of the Database you wish to search in. (See [Notion documentation](https://developers.notion.com/reference/retrieve-a-database) on how to find your Database ID.) Then you can run the following command:
```bash
mint run notion2markdown \
--notion-token <your-notion-token> \
--database-id <your-database-id>
```

Additionally, if you wish to save the markdown to a local file, supply the `--output-directory` option:
```bash
mint run notion2markdown \
--notion-token <your-notion-token> \
--database-id <your-database-id> \
--output-directory <your-output-directory> \
```
