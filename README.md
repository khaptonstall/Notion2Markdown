## Getting Started

### Create a Notion Integration
In order for Notion2Markdown to have access to your Notion account, you must first set up a new Internal Integration, which can be done on the [My Integrations page](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations).

Note: You only need to ensure the **Read Content** box is checked under the Capabilities for your integration.

Now you need to connect a Database to your new Integration.

Back in the Notion app, go to your Database, select the â‹¯ button in the top-right, then select "Connect to" and choose your new Integration. (If your Integration isn't displayed, try refreshing Notion.)
